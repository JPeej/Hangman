<h1 align="center">Hangman</h1>

I was tasked to create a Hangman in my class, "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" by Dr. Angela Wu. I am taking this Udemy class on the side of my official coursework at Western Governors University. This is day seven of the class. This task was somewhat guided. Various steps were brought forth as challenges. We were encouraged to produce our own solutions. After we were completed, the teacher then revealed her solution. I kept mine for the most part but did tweak a few items per her recommendation.

<h2>I was to focus on using the following concepts that I learned today.</h2>

-Using a flow chart to break down a complex project.

-Using print strategically throughout your code during development to test for proper operation.

-All tools we have learned up until this point.

<h2>What I learned</h2>
This was the first project in which I created my own modules, imported them into the main.py, and called upon them. Very satisfying to see that work. I used the draw.io extenstion made by a third party in VSCode to create the flowchart for this project. Having that handy and speaking through it became very useful for understanding what I needed within my code. There was a lot of reinforcment of concepts that I learned earlier. I experienced a lot of the googling for concepts I had learned before but just needed clarity on syntax. I was mostly happy with how everything went and the fact that I knew what to google for when I needed it.

<h2>Issues I had and where I can do better.</h2>
The biggest issue I had was to tell the user if they had input the guess before. I wanted to make sure the user was neither rewarded or punished. However, I kept getting the user punished. This was happening for two reasons:

1) I was incrementing the guess into the stored list before the reward/punishment if statement.

2) I wasn't checking if the guess was in the stored list before punishing.
